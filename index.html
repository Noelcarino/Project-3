                <p>The name <code>Cytus</code> is taken from Cocytus, the Greek mythological river of wailing or lamentation. <code>Cytus</code> features a story plot that is carried through its 10 main chapters as well as a prologue.</p>
                
                <p>The story revolves around the protagonist, Vanessa, who lives in a 22nd-century world where robots with human memories are the only remaining sentient beings while living humas are killed by a mutant virus. Due to limited memory space, human emotions are stored in the form of music in <code>"Cytus"</code>, and by playing the songs, the robots are able to revive their human emotions.</p>
                
                <p>The plot features the disaster and the protagonist's struggle with identity.</p>
                
                <p>The story is told in-game through various cut-scenes that are unique to the chapter title songs; in comparison, the other individual songs within each chapter are at most only marginally relevant to the plot, except for a limited few.</p>
                
                <p>The main gameplay of <code>Cytus</code> features the Active Scan Line, a black line that move up and down across the screen. The player taps circular objects, referred to as Notes, as the Active Scan Line passes over them, following the music.</p>
                
                <p>Three types of Notes are used. The Click Note, a single circular note, requires tapping the object in time. The Drag Note, a continuous track of notes, requires dragging along the track. The Hold Note, a note with an extended ribbon meter, requires holding over the note until the meter is filled. Notes to be hit as the line rises are colored blue and purple, while those as the line drops are colored yellow and green.</p>
                
                <p>Each Note is judged by the accuracy to be either Perfect, Good, Bad or Miss. The better the accuracy, the higher score is given. The maximum score is 1,000,000, and a minimum of 700,000 is required to clear a stage.</p>
                
                <p>Basic score is 900,000, the score is divided equally into every note. Combo score is 100,000, the score is proportional to square of the maximum combo. Also, the maximum TP score is 100, and TP Perfect, NM Perfect, Good, Bad, Miss is calculated 100%, 70%, 30%, 0%, 0%, respectively. </p>

                <header>Dynasty Warriors 3</header>
                
                <p><code>Dynasty Warriors 3</code> is a hack and slash video game devloped by Omega Force and published by Koei and THQ. It the third <code>Dynasty Warriors</code> series in North America and the second in the <i>Shin Sangokumusou</i> series in Japan.</p>
                
                <p>It is a spin-off from the video game Romance of the Three Kingdoms and based around a series of books the same name, written by Luo Guanzhong</p>
                
                <p>It contains a number of fictional elements from the same era in Chinese history that Romance of the Three Kingdoms is set but follows the main events of part of the story which is to unify China under the single rule of a Kingdom</p>
                
                <p><code>Dynasty Warriors 3</code> was the first in the series to introduce a two player mode and numerous other improvements over <code>Dynasty Warriors 2</code>. New stages, characters, weapons, attacks and music are introduced providing a completely new experience to a player that has played <code>Dynasty Warriors 2</code> before.</p>
                
                <p>The game play engine and the graphics engine have also been updated, providing higher quality environments, textures and general overall graphics. Only one expansion was released for the game, <code>Dynasty Warrios 3: Xtreme Legends</code> and it was the first in the Xtreme Legend series</p>
                
                <p>In <code>Dynasty Warriors 3</code> the player takes control of an officer and must attempt to defeat the enemy commander. The player must make their way through the stage defeating soldiers and enemy officers while trying to keep their commander alive. As well as hundreds of soldiers in each stage, there are stage specific events to complete that can help the player's army and raise their moral.</p>
                
                <p>A higher morale means allied soldiers will attack more frequently and will be more likely to follow through with their combination attacks. To make this possible, officers and commanders have superhuman abilities and have the capability to kill hundreds of enemy soldiers per stage. </p>
                
                <p>The main play mode of the game is Musou mode, the story mode of the <code>Dynasty Warriors</code> series.

                <p>The Musou mode for each character is a linear story where the user cannot change how the story progresses. The story progression for Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Sun Jian and officers from their kingdoms have closest relation to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms story</p>
                
                <p>Initially there are 15 available characters to play as and new characters can be unlocked by performing special events during battle or simply meeting them during battle. Each playable character has their own unique weapon that can be upgraded and allows for a maximum of 4 levels of weapon. When the next level of weapon is obtained, its strength is greater than the level below it and adds one extra attack to the player's maximum number of attacks. </p>
